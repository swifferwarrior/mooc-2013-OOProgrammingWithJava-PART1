OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH JAVA, PART I
# ooc-2013-OOProgrammingWithJava-PART1

Exercises for Part 1 of "Programming with Java" MOOC from University of Helsinki. Includes Post-Submit Notes in the code.

Starting with Excercise 86, Post-Submit Notes were added at the end of each class where I got stuck. These notes are for my own reference
but are also made available for others who may be running into the same roadblocks.
